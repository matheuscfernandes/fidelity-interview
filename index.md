# About Matheus C. Fernandes
I am a finishing PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. As a NSF-GRFP fellow, my PhD thesis involves numerically modeling bio-inspired optimized materials and applying generative parametric machine learning algorithms to control soft robotic actuators and classify objects based on embedded sensor data. You may watch a TED-style talk on my research work on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/u16FjNGMoEs).

I have earned a Masters of Science (S.M.) in Computational Science and Engineering in 2020 from Harvard and earned a terminal Masters of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Engineering Sciences with a concentration in Mechanical Engineering and Material Science in 2015 also from Harvard. My M.Eng. thesis was on modeling 'Mechanics of Subglacial Hydrology under Supraglacial Lakes and Ice Stream Shear Margins'.

# About Allegheny County
<img src="./assets/alleghenyct.png" width='40%'>

# Project Goal
Develop a monthly “Allegheny County Home Value Index” (HVI) to understand key features of the market. Create model to gain insights for investment opportunities.

# About the Dataset
The dataset can be obtained from the [Western PA Regional Data Center](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/property-assessments), which can be downloaded directily from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ordhz0pszt4v4x7/assessments.csv?dl=1). Each of the features contained in the dataset are explained in [this document](./assets/property-assessment-data-dictionaryrev.pdf).

## Method

## Assumptions

# Conclusions

Based on the resutls obtained from the model alone under the stated assumptions, I do not suggest investing in the housing stock on Allegheny county at the moment. If the costumer currenly holds properties holdings at the moment, I would recommend liquidating the assets 

However, uncertainties arising  unaccounting for additional
