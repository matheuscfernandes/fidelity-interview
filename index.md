# About Matheus C. Fernandes
I am a finishing PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. As a NSF-GRFP fellow, my PhD thesis involves numerically modeling bio-inspired optimized materials and applying generative parametric machine learning algorithms to control soft robotic actuators and classify objects based on embedded sensor data.

I have earned a Masters of Science (S.M.) in Computational Science and Engineering in 2020 from Harvard and earned a terminal Masters of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Engineering Sciences with a concentration in Mechanical Engineering and Material Science in 2015 also from Harvard. My M.Eng. thesis was on modeling 'Mechanics of Subglacial Hydrology under Supraglacial Lakes and Ice Stream Shear Margins'.
